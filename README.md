Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wants to make a web-based game that is able of running on multiple platforms. The game, "Draw It or Lose It", is currently only compatible with Android OS devices and so, The Gaming Room would like to further develop their game to run on all current operating systems.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel that I did particularly well in developing the design contraints and recommendations that would be needed for understanding where to start development for Draw It or Lose It

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The most advantageous part of writing the design document was being able to think through and design the overarching infrastructure of the code. Without the high-level design of how each class and object interacted with each other, writing the code would have been more difficult.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to be able to work more on my evaluations. Even though a majority of the evaluations were all similar in demand, next time I would like to be able to find different things that are needed for each.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I started off by reading thoroughly the interview transcript. Everything they said that I could interpret as a deliverable, I wrote down. When I had a full list ready, I started to think about how those would be done via software or if they were external requirements. If the requirement was external, I would set it aside and focus on the ones I saw a clear application for in the software.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When developing software, I am still new at the whole process. What I try to do is read all of the requirements first while writing down what I believe are the essentials in a checklist. Then, I try to isolate the objects in the system and how they interact
